# Visualization of Branches for Italian Banking Groups

In this project I use Dash and Mapbox to visualize on a map what the combination of different banking groups in Italy would look like from the perspective of their branch network.

In addition, I complement the branches with a histogram of the largest banks in Italy by number of branches and a choropleth map showing economic indicators by province.

Credits:
+ The databases (branches and economic indicators) are sourced from the Bank of Italy
+ The base code for the choropleth map comes from Vincenzo Pota: [Github Repository](https://github.com/vincepota/plotly_choropleth_tutorial)
+ The geojson for the Italian provinces updated to 2019 comes from Openpolis [Github Repository](https://github.com/openpolis/geojson-italy?files=1)

Other useful resources for Dash / Mapbox:
+ Adriano Yoshino's video tutorial on Dash and Mapbox: [Github Repository](https://github.com/amyoshino/Dash_Tutorial_Series)

The output is available on Heroku: [App Link](https://dash-mapbox-italian-banks.herokuapp.com/)
